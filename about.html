      <h1> About us </h1>
      <hr>
      <p> We are a nonprofit organization based on helping others. This was started because it's been too long since anyone has helped these unfortunate people </p>
      
      <h2> How you can help </h2>
      <hr>
      <p> If you would like to help out, you can scroll down and click the "Donate" button. It will take you to a form that asks how much you want to donate, where you want to help or if you want to help a specific organization, and if you want your name to be mentioned. After that is submitted, the next page is payment information and your billing address. The billing address is important because if you donate, you will be sent a card and a small prize. The larger the donation, the larger the prize. You can even specify what kind of prize you want to recieve. </p>
